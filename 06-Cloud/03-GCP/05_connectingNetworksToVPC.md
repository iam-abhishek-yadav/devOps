## Connecting Networks in Google Cloud

Google Cloud customers often need to connect their Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks to other networks, such as on-premises networks or networks in different clouds. Here are several effective ways to achieve this:

### 1. **Virtual Private Network (VPN) Connection:**
   - Establish a connection over the internet using Cloud VPN to create a tunnel connection.
   - Use Cloud Router to make the connection dynamic and exchange route information over VPN using BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
   - Ensures automatic route updates when adding new subnets to Google VPC.

### 2. **Direct Peering:**
   - "Peering" with Google using Direct Peering by placing a router in the same public data center as a Google point of presence.
   - More than 100 Google points of presence worldwide.
   - Customers not in a point of presence can use the Carrier Peering program for connection through a service provider's network.

### 3. **Carrier Peering:**
   - Leverage the Carrier Peering program to connect to Google's network through a service provider.
   - Provides direct access from on-premises networks through a service provider's network to Google Workspace and Google Cloud products.
   - Ensures connectivity through public IP addresses.

### 4. **Dedicated Interconnect:**
   - Provides one or more direct, private connections to Google with topologies meeting Googleâ€™s specifications.
   - Covered by an SLA of up to 99.99% for high reliability.
   - Can be backed up by a VPN for additional reliability.

### 5. **Partner Interconnect:**
   - Provides connectivity between on-premises and VPC networks through a supported service provider.
   - Useful when a data center can't reach a Dedicated Interconnect colocation facility or for lower bandwidth requirements.
   - Can be configured with an SLA of up to 99.99%.

### 6. **Cross-Cloud Interconnect:**
   - Establish high-bandwidth dedicated connectivity between Google Cloud and another cloud service provider.
   - Google provisions a physical connection between networks, supporting an integrated multicloud strategy.
   - Available in 10 Gbps or 100 Gbps sizes.
   - Offers reduced complexity, site-to-site data transfer, and encryption.
   - Supports various cloud service providers.
