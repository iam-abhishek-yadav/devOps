## File Storage - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) and Amazon FSx

### Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a hassle-free file system that dynamically adjusts its size as files are added or removed. It eliminates the need for provisioning and managing storage capacity and performance. Key features include:

- **Scalability:** Amazon EFS can be connected to tens, hundreds, or thousands of compute instances simultaneously, ensuring consistent performance for each instance.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Users pay only for the storage used, with no minimum fees or setup costs.
- **Storage Classes:**
  - *Standard and Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA):* Offer Multi-AZ resilience with high durability and availability.
  - *One Zone and One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA):* Provide cost savings by storing data in a single availability zone.
