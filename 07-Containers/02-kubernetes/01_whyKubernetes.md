## Why Kubernetes?
Containers offer an efficient way to package and run applications. However, in a production environment, managing the deployment, scaling, and resilience of containers becomes crucial. This is where Kubernetes shines, providing a robust framework for orchestrating and managing containerized applications.

## Key Features of Kubernetes

### Service Discovery and Load Balancing
Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or their own IP address. It ensures stable deployment by load balancing and distributing network traffic to handle high traffic situations.

### Storage Orchestration
Automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more.

### Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks
Describe the desired state for your containers, and Kubernetes can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. It supports automated deployment processes like canary deployments.

### Automatic Bin Packing
Optimizes resource usage by fitting containers onto nodes based on specified CPU and memory requirements.

### Self-Healing
Kubernetes automatically restarts, replaces, or kills containers that fail or don't respond to health checks, ensuring continuous service availability.

### Secret and Configuration Management
Securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. Kubernetes supports deploying and updating secrets and application configurations without rebuilding container images.

### Batch Execution
Manages batch and CI workloads, replacing failing containers as needed.

### Horizontal Scaling
Scale applications up or down easily through commands, a user interface, or automated scaling based on CPU usage.

### IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack
Supports allocation of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services.

### Designed for Extensibility
Enables adding features to a Kubernetes cluster without changing upstream source code.
